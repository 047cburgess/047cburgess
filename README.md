# Hi there, I'm Casey 👋

## 🧚🏼‍♀️ About Me
I'm a student at École 42 Paris, about 2 years into a career transition from 5 years in global marketing product development to software development.

I discovered coding during a Discovery Piscine for women at 42, and what hooked me was the creative problem solving, endless learning, and opportunity to follow my curiosity.

I'm currently looking for a 6-month internship where I can learn from experienced developers while contributing a product and user mindset, a collaborative approach, and continuing to grow as a developer.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring wellbeing practices, working on creative projects, enjoying classical music, or spending time with animals. 🎵🐾
