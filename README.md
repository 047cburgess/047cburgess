# Hi there, I'm Casey 👋

## 🧚🏼‍♀️ About Me
I'm currently a student at **École 42**, transitioning from a 5-year career as an **Innovation Manager** in Global Brand Marketing across Fragrance, Ice Cream, and Stationery sectors.

I discovered coding through a desire to learn something new. What drew me in, and keeps me hooked, is the endless opportunity for creative problem-solving and meaningful impact. Every project is a puzzle to solve, a system to understand, and an opportunity to learn something new.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring wellbeing practices, working on creative projects, enjoying classical music, or spending time with animals. 🎵🐾
